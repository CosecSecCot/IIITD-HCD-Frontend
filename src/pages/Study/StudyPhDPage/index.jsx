              The PhD program at IIIT-Delhi is focused towards research like any
              other PhD program â€“ limited coursework to enhance the breadth and
              depth of a student, followed by focused research. Admissions are
              made through regular admission process as well as rolling mode.
              Regular admissions for all disciplines are made in March-April and
              Nov-Dec every year. For rolling admission, the interested
              candidates are expected to interact with the concerned faculty
              member(s) in IIIT-Delhi and get their consent for working with
              him/her. However, such candidates will undergo a full selection
              process before being admitted to the PhD program.
